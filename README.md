## Car Dekho - Used Car Price Pridiction

### INTRODUCTION
The Car Dheko - Used Car Price Prediction project aims to enhance customer experience and streamline the pricing process for used cars. By leveraging machine learning, we developed an accurate and user-friendly tool that predicts used car prices based on various features such as make, model, year, fuel type, transmission type, and more. The model is integrated into an interactive Streamlit application for real-time price predictions.

### OBJECTIVES
1. Develop a machine learning-based system to predict used car prices.
2. Provide real-time price prediction tool for customers and sales representatives.
3. Improve the accuracy and consistency of used car pricing.
4. Create an interactive web application for easy user access.

### DATASETS
The dataset used in this project is collected from Car Dekho, a popular online platform for buying and selling used cars in India. It includes various attributes about used cars listed for sale across multiple cities.
Key attributes in the dataset include:

1. Car Specifications: Make, model, year of manufacture, fuel type, transmission type, and body type.
2. Condition Variables: Number of previous owners, kilometers driven, and car’s condition.
3. Price Data: Listed price, actual price, and price saving information (if available).
4. Other Features: Includes details such as OEM, car variant, trending data, and more.

### DATA CLEANING AND INTEGRATION
The initial step involved cleaning and preprocessing the dataset to ensure accuracy and consistency. The following actions were taken:

1. Missing Values: Imputed or removed missing values to maintain data integrity.
2. Duplicates: Identified and removed duplicate records.
3. Data Types: Ensured appropriate data types for each column.
4. Feature Engineering: Encoded categorical variables and scaled numerical features.

### CONCLUSION
The Car Dheko – Used Car Price Prediction project successfully developed a machine learning-based solution to predict the prices of used cars. The Random Forest model, with an R-squared value of 0.927, demonstrated high accuracy in price predictions. The integration of the model into an interactive Streamlit-based web application enhances the decision-making process for both prospective buyers and sellers, streamlining the pricing process and increasing customer satisfaction.
